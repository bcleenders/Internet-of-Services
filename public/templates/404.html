    <h1>Page not found</h1>

    <p>You requested a page that we currently cannot serve.</p>

    {{#if message}}
        <p><strong>Error message:</strong> {{message}}</p>
    {{/if}}

    <p>
        To fix this problem, you could try to:
        <ul>
            <li>Use the link in the ISIS tool. Copy/pasting or otherwise sharing the link does <strong>not</strong> work.</li>
            <li>Check whether the enrollment is already open.</li>
            <li>Ask your professor.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Apologies for the inconvenience.
